# CPU7Plus
A GUI-based emulator for the Centurion-series minicomputer

Right now this is very much a WIP, the basic framework for the processor register viewer / CPU control buttons are there, but that is about it. The actual CPU emulation is extremely barebones (it can only really execute jump instructions right now).

The next step is getting the memory viewer / editor working.
